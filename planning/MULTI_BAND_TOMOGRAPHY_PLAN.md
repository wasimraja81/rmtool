# Multi-Band Faraday Tomography — Feasibility & Design Plan

Branch: `multi-band-tomography` (from `develop`)

**Status: planning only. No code changes on this branch yet.**

## 1. Motivation

Today rmtool ingests exactly one Q cube and one U cube
(`cfg%infileQ`/`cfg%infileU`), covering a single, contiguous, uniformly-sampled
frequency band, and RM-synthesises them directly. Multi-band tomography means
ingesting **several Q/U cube pairs from different frequency bands** (e.g. a
low-band and a high-band observation of the same field, possibly from
different instruments/pipelines) and RM-synthesising across the combined
frequency coverage in one run. Wider, multi-band λ² coverage is what actually
buys better RM resolution and reduces sidelobes in the RM spread function —
that is the scientific point of this effort.

## 2. Requirements (as given)

1. Ingest multiple Q cubes and multiple U cubes (one Q/U pair per band).
2. Verify that all cubes share a matching geometry before doing anything else
   — if they don't match, refuse to run rather than produce a silently wrong
   result.
3. **Decision needed:** attempt on-the-fly geometry matching (reprojection),
   or require the caller to hand rmtool already-matched cubes?
   - 3a. Geometry matching in the on-the-fly case requires RA/Dec overlap
     detection and WCS reprojection.
   - 3b. Cubes must also match in angular resolution (beam) — today rmtool
     assumes one resolution for the whole run and never checks it.

**Decision recorded (confirmed with user, 2026-07-20):** rmtool will
**require pre-matched geometry** for v1. Reprojection/regridding and
resolution-matching (convolution to a common beam) are the caller's
responsibility, done upstream with existing astronomy tools (e.g.
`reproject`, `montage`, a common-resolution convolution step) before handing
cubes to rmtool. rmtool's job is to **validate** that what it was given
actually matches — pixel grid, WCS, and (new) resolution — and refuse to run
otherwise, exactly as it already does for the single Q/U pair today. This is
a much smaller lift than building a reprojection engine, and it keeps the
tiled I/O and parallelism model completely untouched (see §4). It does not
solve the problem for a user whose bands are natively on different pixel
grids — they must regrid first — but that tradeoff was made explicitly,
not by default.

## 3. Current architecture: what "ingest" and "geometry" mean today

Evidence, all from `src/rm_synthesis.f90` and `src/myfits_info.f90` on
`develop`:

- **Ingestion is hardcoded to one Q/U pair.** `cfg%infileQ`/`cfg%infileU`
  are single `character` fields in `rmsynth_config_t`
  (`src/rm_synthesis_mod.f90:109`), read once each via `read_cfg_keyval`
  and enforced as required keys
  (`src/rm_synthesis_mod.f90:2585-2589`). There is no array/list-of-files
  concept anywhere in the config parser.
- **Geometry, as validated today, means exact equality**, not overlap or
  reprojection. `myfits_info` (`src/myfits_info.f90:21-166`) reads per-cube
  `NAXIS`, `NAXES`, and `CRVAL1/2`, `CRPIX1/2`, `CDELT1/2` (RA/Dec) plus
  `CRVAL/CRPIX/CDELT` on whichever axis carries `CTYPE*=FREQ`
  (`myfits_info.f90:105-118`, `146-156`). `rm_synthesis.f90:594-666` then
  requires Q and U to agree on: frequency-axis index, `NAXIS`, and every
  `NAXES(i)` (pixel-for-pixel dimension equality); a second block,
  `rm_synthesis.f90:733-806`, separately enforces bit-identical
  `CRVAL/CRPIX/CDELT` on the RA, Dec, and frequency axes, hard `stop`-ing on
  any mismatch with no tolerance. None of this is a WCS-aware overlap
  computation — it's exact-value equality end to end. There is no rotation
  matrix (`PCi_j`/`CROTA2`) handling anywhere in the codebase — the existing
  check implicitly assumes no differential rotation between cubes, which
  holds trivially today because Q and U are always the same physical cube
  pair.
- **No resolution (beam) information is read or checked at all.** A search
  for `BMAJ`/`BMIN`/`BPA` across `src/` returns nothing. Matching resolution
  across the whole run is an unstated, unenforced assumption today, true only
  because there has only ever been one input band.
- **Frequency sampling is assumed to be one linear grid per cube.** The
  spectral axis is described by a single `(CRVAL, CRPIX, CDELT)` triple per
  cube (`myfits_info.f90:142-156`); `rm_synthesis.f90:1511-1562` derives the
  absolute frequency of every channel, and hence every channel's λ² in
  `L_sq` (`rm_synthesis.f90:1482`, populated inside the same block), from
  that single triple plus `nz_totpix`. Bad/flagged channels are masked via
  `flag_arr`/`flag_arr_out` (weight-zeroed in the DFT), but they are still
  members of the one uniform grid — nothing in the codebase currently
  supports two cubes whose channels are not literally contiguous, evenly
  spaced samples of the same linear axis. Two bands from different receivers
  will essentially never satisfy that; combining them means building one
  merged, non-uniform frequency/λ² list, which today's `L_sq` construction
  does not do.
- **RM-axis sampling parameters (`ofac`, `fac`, `beg_rm`, `end_rm`, `nrm`) are
  single, run-wide scalars** (`rmsynth_config_t` fields,
  `src/rm_synthesis_mod.f90`; consumed at `rm_synthesis.f90:1615-1616` via
  `extract_general_setup`). Multi-band synthesis still wants exactly one RM
  axis for the whole run — this part needs no new concept, just a frequency
  list long enough to cover every band's channels.

## 4. Parallelism framework: what carries over, what doesn't

Reference: `docs/PARALLELISM.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

**There is no MPI, and no multi-process/multi-node decomposition of any
kind** (`grep -rniE "mpi_init|use mpi|mpif" src/ Makefile build.sh` — zero
hits; the Slurm example at `scratch/slurm/run_rm-synthesis.sbatch:9-11`
requests `--nodes=1 --ntasks=1`). Every parallelism axis described below is
intra-node: OpenMP host threads and/or GPU target-offload. Multi-band
tomography therefore stays within the same single-node execution model —
there is no existing "distribute work across processes" mechanism to either
reuse or work around.

The existing decomposition is:
- **Tiles**: serial loop over 2D RA/Dec strips, sized by `mem_frac_ram`
  (`plan_tile`/`tile_plan_t`, `src/rm_synthesis_mod.f90:168-195`). Each tile
  read pulls the *full* channel span for that spatial footprint.
- **I/O parallelism**: `io_read_threads` splits **channels** of a single
  input file across independent CFITSIO handles; `io_write_threads` splits
  **RM bins** of the output cube across independent STREAM writers;
  `io_overlap` runs one tile's write concurrently with the next tile's
  read/compute on a background pthread.
- **Compute parallelism**: OpenMP/GPU parallelise over **pixels** (and
  pixel×RM-bin on GPU) within a tile. The channel loop is always sequential
  per pixel, and `cos_arr`/`sin_arr` are precomputed once for the whole run
  from the one `nz_out`-length frequency grid.

### What fits without disruption

| Aspect | Fits current framework? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Spatial tiling (RA/Dec) | **Yes, unchanged** | Tiling is per-sky-position, independent of how many bands feed each pixel's spectrum. A tile is still "this RA/Dec footprint, all channels" — just now "all channels" spans multiple files. |
| Per-pixel OpenMP/GPU parallelism | **Yes, unchanged** | The compute kernel already treats the channel axis as one flat array of length `nz_out` per pixel; it does not care whether the channels came from one file or several, provided the merged spectrum + weights + λ² arrays are assembled correctly before the kernel runs. |
| `io_read_threads` | **Extends naturally** | Read parallelism is already "N independent CFITSIO handles per input file, splitting channels." With K bands, the natural extension is one such handle-set per band (or continue splitting by global channel range, now spanning multiple files) — same mechanism, larger fan-out. |
| `io_write_threads` / `io_overlap` | **Yes, unchanged** | Both operate purely on the *output* AMP/PHA cube and the RM axis, which stays single and run-wide regardless of how many input bands feed it. |
| RM chunking (`nrm_block_size`) | **Yes, unchanged** | Operates on the single merged RM axis; number of input bands is invisible to this stage. |

### What does not fit and needs new design

| Aspect | Fits current framework? | Why not, and what it needs |
|---|---|---|
| Config schema (single `infileQ`/`infileU`) | **No** | Needs a list-of-bands concept (§5) — every place `cfg%infileQ` is read once needs to become "for each band." This is schema and orchestration work, not parallelism work. |
| Geometry validation | **No, must be extended, not reused as-is** | Today's check is Q-vs-U only; needs to become "all N cubes vs. a chosen reference," still exact-equality (per the v1 decision), but now also over resolution (new: read and compare `BMAJ`/`BMIN`/`BPA`), which nothing reads today. |
| Frequency/λ² grid construction | **Mixed — better news than it first looks** | The DFT template kernel itself (`extract_general_setup`, `src/rm_synthesis_mod.f90:642-728`) computes `cos_arr`/`sin_arr` from each channel's λ² **individually** (a direct sum, not an FFT), so it does not algebraically require uniform λ² spacing — a concatenated, gapped, multi-band λ² array would compute correctly through this kernel essentially as-is. The actual gap is entirely upstream, in how that array is *produced*: `myfits_info` reads one `(CRVAL,CRPIX,CDELT)` triple per cube and `linspace`s it into a uniform ramp (`src/rm_synthesis.f90:1561-1563`) — there is no per-channel frequency table anywhere. Multi-band needs that replaced by **concatenating each band's own linspace-derived channel list** (each band can keep its own internal linear grid) into one merged, sorted array, with per-channel weights/flags carried through per band. This changes `nz_out`'s meaning from "one cube's channel count" to "sum of all bands' channel counts," touching every allocation sized by it (`data_arrQ/U`, `flag_arr_out`, `L_sq`, `cos_arr`/`sin_arr`, tile-local `specQ`/`specU`) — sizing/plumbing work, not a kernel rewrite. Two bands with overlapping frequency ranges would need an explicit policy (error, or de-duplicate/average) — open question, §7. Separately, **`use_auto_rm_range=1`'s default RM-range heuristic does assume uniform spacing** (`dfreq = (freq_MHz(npts)-freq_MHz(1))/(npts-1)`, `src/rm_synthesis_mod.f90:656-687`) and would silently compute a wrong range/resolution across a multi-band gap; the safe path for v1 is requiring `use_auto_rm_range=0` (explicit `beg_rm`/`end_rm`/`nrm`) whenever more than one band is supplied, until this heuristic is made band-aware.
| Tile read stage | **Partially — needs a per-band read loop, not a redesign** | `tile_read` currently issues one `FTGSVE` call (or `io_read_threads`-many) per input file. With K bands it becomes a loop of K such call-groups into disjoint slices of one enlarged `specQ`/`specU` buffer — additive complexity, not a new decomposition axis. Bad-channel/mask handling (`flag_arr`) needs to become per-band-aware so a channel flagged bad in band 2 doesn't collide with band 1's indexing. |
| Bias correction / Q-U bias fields (`resiQ`, `slopeQ`, `resiU`, `slopeU`, `infileI`) | **Unclear, needs scoping** | These are currently single scalars/one I-cube for the whole run. Whether Q-U bias correction is per-band (physically more correct, since it's an instrumental effect) or run-wide needs a decision before implementation — not a parallelism question, a science/config question. |

### Summary

The tiling, I/O-thread, and RM-chunk decomposition axes are **orthogonal to
"how many bands feed the frequency axis"** and need no rework — and,
better than initially assumed, neither does the DFT template kernel itself,
which is already per-channel rather than assuming a uniform grid. The real
cost of this feature is concentrated in a narrower band than a first pass
would suggest: the **ingestion/validation/frequency-assembly** layer (turning
"one cube's grid" into "N cubes' grids, merged into one list, each channel
still tagged with which band/file it came from for I/O purposes") plus the
**auto-RM-range heuristic**, which does assume uniform spacing and needs an
explicit multi-band guard. Once the merged per-channel frequency/λ² list and
weight array exist, they can be handed to the existing tile/compute/write
pipeline essentially unchanged. All of this stays within the existing
single-node OpenMP/GPU execution model — there is no distributed-computing
dimension to design around.

## 5. Sketch of a config schema (not final, no code written)

Current single-band schema (`cfg/rmsynth.cfg`):
```
infileQ = Q_cube.fits
infileU = U_cube.fits
```

A natural extension, keeping backward compatibility for existing single-band
configs:
```
nbands  = 2
infileQ_1 = low_Q.fits   infileU_1 = low_U.fits
infileQ_2 = high_Q.fits  infileU_2 = high_U.fits
```
(or a comma-separated list form — either is a config-parser change only,
independent of the feasibility questions above; picking the exact syntax is
an implementation-time decision, not an architectural one).

## 6. Recommended phasing

1. **Geometry/resolution validation, N-file ingestion, still single
   contiguous band each but multiple bands concatenated.** Smallest useful
   slice: prove the "N files in, one merged frequency list out, existing
   pipeline unchanged downstream" shape works, with the fewest moving parts.
2. **Frequency/λ² merge + per-band bad-channel handling.** The structural
   work identified as the biggest gap in §4.
3. **Bias-correction semantics decision + implementation**, once scoped.
4. **Multi-band-aware diagnostics**: swim-lane/log output currently reports
   one `bytes=` figure per tile read; extending it to show per-band
   breakdown is a nice-to-have, not a blocker.

Each phase should get its own ticket(s) in the style of
`planning/ENCAPSULATION_REFACTOR_PLAN.md` / `IO_PARALLEL_OPTIMISATION_PLAN.md`
(Objective/Scope/Change Set/Correctness Gate/Rollback Criteria/Effort) once
this feasibility plan is agreed, rather than being written speculatively here.

## 7. Open questions (not resolved by this document)

- **Overlapping frequency ranges between bands**: error out, or define a
  merge policy (e.g. prefer one band, average, or weight by both)?
- **Bias correction fields** (`resiQ`/`slopeQ`/`resiU`/`slopeU`/`infileI`):
  per-band or run-wide?
- **Resolution-mismatch tolerance**: exact equality on `BMAJ`/`BMIN`/`BPA`
  (mirroring today's exact-equality philosophy for pixel grid), or a
  configurable tolerance given real beam-fitting noise between independent
  observations?
- **What counts as "the reference geometry"** when validating N cubes: the
  first band listed, or an explicit `reference_band` config key?
- **`use_auto_rm_range` for multi-band runs**: forbid it outright (require
  `use_auto_rm_range=0` whenever `nbands>1`), or invest in making the
  Brentjens & de Bruyn default-range heuristic band-gap-aware?

## 8. Non-goals for this effort

- WCS reprojection/regridding of mismatched cubes (rejected for v1, §2).
- Convolution to a common resolution (rejected for v1, §2 — resolution
  matching is validated, not performed).
- Mosaicking (combining cubes covering *different* sky regions into one
  footprint) — out of scope; this effort is about combining different
  *frequency* coverage of the *same* sky region.
- Any change to the numerical RM-synthesis kernel itself
  (`extract_general_setup`, `tile_extract_gpu_rm_blocked`) beyond how many
  channels it's handed — same guardrail this repo already applies in
  `planning/ENCAPSULATION_REFACTOR_PLAN.md`.
